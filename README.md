vMHD: vectorized implementation of the Modified Hausdorff Distance. 
 - The vectorized implementation is computationally more efficient than the 
 for-loop version at the cost of ram memory.
 - As described by Dubuisson and Jain in:
 
 M. P. Dubuisson and A. K. Jain. A Modified Hausdorff distance for object 
 matching. In ICPR94, pages A:566-568, Jerusalem, Israel, 1994.
